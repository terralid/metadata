# Sling bullets

Sling bullet specific metadata are based on Müller, R., Klein S., Schreiner, K., Reid, J. (2024), Lead isotope analyses (LIA) on lead sling bullets from Pre-Roman and Roman context. GFZ Data Services. <https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2024.003> and include the metadata compiled there that are not covered elsewhere in the metadata profile.  

They are currently conceptualised as extension of the [metal-specific metadata](metadata_metal.md). However, this will likely change in a future version because sling bullets were also made from other materials, especially ceramics.
